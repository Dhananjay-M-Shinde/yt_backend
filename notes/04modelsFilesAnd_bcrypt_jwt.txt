we creates the schema in models folder only

for user
for video

while writing schema should follow the given format
we also have to use timestamps because it generate createdAt and updatedAt fields automatically
and at the end we export the schema by below way
export User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema)

in these files only we can encrypt and decrypt the password field using bcrypt library
while encryption we use pre hook avaiable in mongoose schema which runs just before we save the data to database

while decrypting we create custome method using "methods" in schema like userSchema.methods.isPasseordCorrect
