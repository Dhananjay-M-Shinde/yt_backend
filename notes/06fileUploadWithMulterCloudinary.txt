we are using multer to upload files in backend and we will upload it to cloudinary
cloudinary is free to use

we can directly upload the file to cloudinary instead of saving it temporary to our server. but we are saving it to just give it another chance incase the upload fails

we will write the upload code for cloudinary in cloudinary.js file which we will define in utils because we are using cloudinary as a utility 
you can get all required code api_key, secret_key by logging in to your cloudinary account
once uploaded it return the response which contains many fields like url which we will need to store in database

after that we will write the code to upload the file to our local server with the help of multer middleware which we will define in middleware folder.
the code for the same you can get from npm multer
it return the filepath which we can use later on to remove that file from our server
