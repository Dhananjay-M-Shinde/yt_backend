while connecting to database you should write the database connection code in db/index.js 
then the function should be invoke in src/index.js file and also use promis to handle resolve and reject
if database is connected successfully then in "then" we start the server using app.listen

this is how we ensure that our application is connected to database and then only we start to listen to server.
