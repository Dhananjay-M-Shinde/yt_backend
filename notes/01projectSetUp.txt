first create project folder.
then npm init it will add package.json file to directory
create readme.md file

then create .env .gitignore and .env.sample file 
// .env file used to store enviroment variable like port, hashcode and secure key and data's.
// .gitignore used to add the file which we want not to be tracked by gitignore
then create one public folder inside that create temp folder add .gitkeep file just because now git can track that folder because git won't track the folder which are empty.

then create src folder which is main folder.

inside src folder create below files and folders
1 - app.js  application entry point
2 - index.js  application entry point
3 - constants.js
4 - controllers - this folder contain all functionalities
5 - db - all db connection created in this folder
6 - model - database models are created in this folder
7 - routes - this folder handles the routes
8 - middlewares - some additional functionalities are written in this folder
9 - utils - this is utilities folder utilities like checking for email validation, phone no. validations


then use command npm i -D prettier to install prettier dependency
this is use to standerdise the code writing like tab space, singleQuote
after installtion we need to add .prettierrc file inside which 
{
    "singleQuote": false,
    "bracketSpacing": true,
    "tabWidth": 2,
    "trailingComma": "es5",
    "semi": true
}  we have to write this content
then we need to create .prettierignore file in which we have to mention the files that prettier should not look into to avoid any messup like in .env, node_modules file

then we have to install nodemon using npm i -D nodemon
nodemon basically restarts the server every time you made changes in any file.

here above in both installation we are using -D it denotes that we are installing devDependencies
devDependencies are basically dependencies which are only needed in developement time. they make developement easier.
